### About John

After years of delving deep into frontend engineering, I still haven't found a consistent way of learning. It's been a constant process of trial and error. But as they say, the more mistakes you make, the more you learn 🫣

Whenever I find the best solution, I'm ecstatic and often forget to document the process. That's why I helped create this website, not only to track my learning progress, but also to share my experiences with others and become a more professional developer 👨‍🚀

### About Jordan

Frontend technology is always changing, and we gotta keep up with the latest updates by learning and reviewing constantly. Especially when it comes to interviews, it's crucial to go over some common questions and topics. So we decided to create our own cheatsheet to make reviewing and prepping for the interview boss a lot easier!

Let's do this together 🙋🏻🙋‍♀️
